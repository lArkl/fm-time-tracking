## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript event and element creation

### What I learned

* Practiced Javascript element creation and decided to update values when selecting frequnecy instead of create and delete elements each time. To check the effects of the tasks, I created a mock version in html for the first task to try possible structure of that component and its styling.

* I also practiced Grid layouts areas with responsiveness.

### Continued development
